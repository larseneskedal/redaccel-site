⚠️  REDDIT API CREDENTIALS NEEDED

Your Reddit API credentials are still set to placeholder values.

QUICK FIX (2 minutes):
1. Go to: https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
2. Click "create another app" or "create app"
3. Choose "script" type
4. Copy:
   - Client ID (the string under your app name)
   - Secret (the "secret" field)
5. Send me:
   - Your Reddit Client ID
   - Your Reddit Client Secret  
   - Your Reddit username (for user agent)

Then I'll add them to your .env file immediately!

Or edit .env yourself and replace:
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_actual_secret
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=RedditCommentTool/1.0 by your_username
