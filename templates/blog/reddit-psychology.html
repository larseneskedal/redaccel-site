    <p>
      Reddit is one of the few places on the internet where anonymous strangers will happily tell you exactly what they
      think – about your product, your category, and your competitors. That brutal honesty is a gift, but it also means
      the community has a low tolerance for anything that smells like corporate marketing.
    </p>

    <h2>1. The Core Social Contract of Reddit</h2>
    <p>
      Every subreddit is built on a simple promise: <em>we’re here to help each other</em>. People upvote posts and comments
      that are useful, funny or vulnerable, and they downvote anything that feels self‑serving.
    </p>
    <p>
      When brands ignore that contract – by dropping in with a press release or a thinly veiled ad – users react
      accordingly. The post is downvoted, removed by mods, and mentally filed under “spam”.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Identity, Status and Belonging</h2>
    <p>
      On Reddit, your “brand” is your username and comment history. People click through to see how long you’ve been
      around, what else you talk about, and whether you contribute more than you take. This is why throwaway accounts
      that only ever post links get ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Redaccel, we build and manage persistent personas that participate in communities over time. We answer
      questions, share frameworks, and only mention clients when it genuinely adds value.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Story Beats Slogan Every Time</h2>
    <p>
      Redditors respond to stories, not slogans. “Here’s what happened when we tried to migrate 200k customers in a
      weekend” will always outperform “Introducing our new enterprise data platform”. The former invites curiosity and
      discussion; the latter triggers ad blindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good Reddit content reads like something you would say to a peer over coffee: honest, specific, a little messy.
      That’s why our writers are trained to think like practitioners first, marketers second.
    </p>

    <h2>4. How to Be Authentically Helpful (Without Being Used)</h2>
    <p>
      Being helpful doesn’t mean giving away your product for free. It means:
    </p>
    <ul class="article-list">
      <li>Sharing mental models and checklists that people can apply today.</li>
      <li>Explaining trade‑offs honestly, even when your solution isn’t the best fit.</li>
      <li>Pointing to competitors when they genuinely solve a use case better.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Paradoxically, this level of honesty makes people <em>more</em> likely to trust you when your product <em>is</em> the right
      answer.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Turning Goodwill Into Pipeline</h2>
    <p>
      Authentic engagement is not charity – it’s strategy. When you consistently show up in front of your ideal buyers
      with useful perspectives, three things happen:
    </p>
    <ul class="article-list">
      <li>People start tagging you unprompted when others ask related questions.</li>
      <li>Your brand becomes the default recommendation for specific problems.</li>
      <li>When you do share a link, it feels like a favour, not an intrusion.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="article-cta">
