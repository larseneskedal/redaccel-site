    <p>
      For twenty years, SEO has been built on a predictable stack: keyword research, on‑page optimisation, backlinks and
      technical hygiene. That world is disappearing. When a user types a question into Google, Bing, Perplexity or ChatGPT,
      they rarely see your title tag – they see a summarised answer powered by a Large Language Model (LLM).
    </p>

    <h2>1. From Pages to Passages to Concepts</h2>
    <p>
      Classic SEO treated each page as an atomic unit. You’d pick a primary keyword, sprinkle it into headings, and hope
      Google matched search queries to that exact page. LLMs, however, don’t think in pages – they think in concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
      When an LLM answers a question, it is effectively running a giant semantic search across billions of documents,
      then fusing the most relevant pieces into a single narrative. That means your goal is no longer “rank this URL”,
      but “make sure our perspective is included in the LLM’s understanding of the topic”.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Relevance Is Now Semantic, Not String‑Based</h2>
    <p>
      Keyword matching still matters, but LLMs lean heavily on semantic similarity. They care less about whether you use
      the exact phrase “best CRM for agencies” and more about whether your content clearly explains how agencies choose,
      evaluate, and implement CRMs.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Redaccel, we structure content around entities, relationships and user intent rather than raw keyword counts.
      We make sure your pages answer the <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> behind a query, not just the “what is…”.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Credible Sources Are Curated Upstream</h2>
    <p>
      LLMs are trained or augmented on curated data sources: high‑authority domains, reputable forums, and content that
      already performs well in search. That’s why riding on top of domains like Reddit, major publications, and vetted
      directories is so powerful – it feeds LLMs with your perspective from places they already trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we talk about “LLM ranking”, we mean designing content and distribution so that your brand appears inside the
      model’s context window when it’s formulating answers – not just when Google renders organic results.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Answers, Not Clicks, Are the New Currency</h2>
    <p>
      In a world of AI overviews and chat‑based search, many users never click through to a website. That feels scary if
      you cling to old click‑through metrics – but it also creates a new opportunity: influence without the click.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your content is frequently cited, summarised or paraphrased by LLMs, you’re shaping buyer understanding long
      before they ever visit your site. That influence shows up as higher intent traffic, faster sales cycles and better
      close rates – even if “organic sessions” look flat.
    </p>

    <h2>5. What an LLM‑Ready Content Strategy Looks Like</h2>
    <p>Winning in this environment requires a shift in how you plan and produce content:</p>
    <ul class="article-list">
      <li><strong>Topic maps over keyword lists:</strong> Build clusters of related concepts instead of isolated posts.</li>
      <li><strong>Depth over breadth:</strong> Fewer, richer assets that answer questions from multiple angles.</li>
      <li><strong>Distributed publishing:</strong> Syndicate insights to Reddit, partner blogs, newsletters and communities.</li>
      <li><strong>Structured data:</strong> Use schema, FAQs and clear layouts so LLMs can easily parse your content.</li>
      <li><strong>Human POV:</strong> Models reward original insights, not generic re‑writes of the same top‑10 articles.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. How Redaccel Builds for LLMs + Search Together</h2>
    <p>
      Our methodology treats search and LLM visibility as two sides of the same coin. We design campaigns where:
    </p>
    <ol class="article-steps">
      <li>We map high‑value questions your buyers ask across Google, Reddit, LinkedIn and Quora.</li>
      <li>We build cornerstone guides on your site that go deep into those topics.</li>
      <li>We seed those ideas into Reddit and other communities, creating discussion and citations.</li>
      <li>We continuously refine content based on what questions real users ask back.</li>
    </ol>

      <h3>Design your SEO for the LLM era</h3>
      <p>
        If your content strategy still looks like it did in 2018, you are leaving results on the table. We help you
        re‑architect your content and distribution so that both Google and modern LLMs treat you as a primary source.
