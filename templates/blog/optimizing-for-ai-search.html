    <p>
      AI‑powered search is less about gaming algorithms and more about being the best possible answer. That sounds
      obvious, but very few sites are structured in a way that makes them easy for models like ChatGPT or Google’s
      Gemini to understand and re‑use.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Start With Questions, Not Keywords</h2>
    <p>
      Users rarely search for “project management software”. They ask:
    </p>
    <ul class="article-list">
      <li>“How do I keep my remote team aligned?”</li>
      <li>“ClickUp vs Asana vs Notion for agencies?”</li>
      <li>“Template for weekly sprint planning?”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Your content plan should be built around these questions. Each key question becomes a long‑form resource, not just a
      paragraph inside a generic feature page.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Make Your Structure Machine‑Readable</h2>
    <p>
      LLMs and search engines rely on structure to understand what matters. We recommend:
    </p>
    <ul class="article-list">
      <li>Use clear H1 → H2 → H3 hierarchy with descriptive headings.</li>
      <li>Add FAQ sections with explicit Q/A pairs that map directly to user questions.</li>
      <li>Implement schema.org markup where relevant (HowTo, FAQ, Product, Article).</li>
      <li>Keep paragraphs short and use bullet lists for key takeaways.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Build Topic Clusters, Not Orphan Posts</h2>
    <p>
      LLMs look for patterns: when multiple high‑quality pages from the same domain cover a topic from different angles,
      it’s a strong signal that you’re a true expert. That’s why we design **topic clusters** instead of one‑off posts.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, instead of one page on “retention marketing”, we’ll create:
    </p>
    <ol class="article-steps">
      <li>An in‑depth guide to retention strategy.</li>
      <li>Case studies showing real retention lifts.</li>
      <li>Playbooks for email, in‑app, and community‑driven retention.</li>
      <li>Supporting articles on metrics, tooling and experiments.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>4. Connect On‑Site Content With Off‑Site Signals</h2>
    <p>
      AI‑powered search still cares what the rest of the internet thinks. That’s why we pair on‑site optimisation with
      off‑site distribution:
    </p>
    <ul class="article-list">
      <li>Publishing distilled insights from your articles on Reddit, LinkedIn and industry forums.</li>
      <li>Encouraging citations and deep links from partners, customers and communities.</li>
      <li>Keeping a light but consistent PR / thought‑leadership drumbeat.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Measure What Actually Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Traditional SEO dashboards obsess over impressions and average position. In an AI‑driven world, smarter metrics are:
    </p>
    <ul class="article-list">
      <li>Branded search volume and share of voice inside your category.</li>
      <li>Demo requests and trials that include “found you on Reddit / Google / ChatGPT” in attribution notes.</li>
      <li>Traffic and conversions from your priority question clusters.</li>
    </ul>

      <h3>Build an AI‑ready content engine</h3>
      <p>
        We help teams move from blog posts that chase keywords to content systems that feed both search and LLMs. If you
        want your brand to be the source models quote, not the site they ignore, we’d love to talk.
