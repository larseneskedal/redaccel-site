    <p>
      Marketers talk about Reddit as a “black box”. Threads either explode or disappear. But under the memes and chaos,
      there is a surprisingly consistent set of mechanics that govern what gets attention – and how that attention turns
      into real traffic for your brand.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Network Effects at the Thread Level</h2>
    <p>
      Reddit is not one big community – it is tens of thousands of micro‑communities (subreddits) with their own rules,
      cultures and moderators. When you hit product‑market fit with a single subreddit, three things happen:
    </p>
    <ul class="article-list">
      <li><strong>High early engagement:</strong> The first 10–20 upvotes arrive quickly, signalling quality to the algorithm.</li>
      <li><strong>Ranking in "Hot":</strong> The post climbs the subreddit’s Hot feed, exposing it to exponentially more users.</li>
      <li><strong>Secondary sharing:</strong> Users cross‑post the thread into adjacent subreddits and private communities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This compounding exposure explains why a single thread can suddenly flood your analytics with thousands of
      highly‑qualified visitors in a weekend.
    </p>

    <h2>2. High Intent, Low Noise</h2>
    <p>
      Reddit’s best subreddits act like always‑on focus groups. Users show up with real problems: “How do I price my
      SaaS?”, “What’s the best CRM for agencies?”, “Has anyone tried X tool?”. These are not top‑of‑funnel vanity clicks –
      they are signals of immediate buying intent.
    </p>
    <p>
      When your brand shows up in those conversations with helpful, non‑spammy answers, you’re effectively running
      consultative sales calls in public. The people who click through are disproportionately likely to be a fit.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Long‑Tail Discovery Through Search</h2>
    <p>
      The real magic happens after the initial spike. Because Reddit threads are so often indexed by Google, they turn
      into long‑tail traffic assets. A thread that answered “how do I migrate from Tool A to Tool B” can quietly receive
      traffic for years as people keep searching that same question.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is why Reddit features so heavily in Redaccel campaigns: we’re not just chasing virality, we’re building an
      inventory of high‑intent entry points into your funnel.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Why Most Brands Fail on Reddit</h2>
    <p>
      Most attempts flop because they treat Reddit like an ad network instead of a conversation. Common mistakes:
    </p>
    <ul class="article-list">
      <li>Posting thin, obviously promotional content that gets downvoted instantly.</li>
      <li>Ignoring subreddit rules and getting flagged by moderators.</li>
      <li>Showing up only when you want to sell something, never when people need help.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Redaccel’s Playbook for Repeatable Wins</h2>
