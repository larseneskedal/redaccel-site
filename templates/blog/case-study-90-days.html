    <p>
      A B2B SaaS client came to us stuck on page three for their primary money keyword. They had been blogging for over a
      year, had a decent backlink profile, and were investing in paid search – but organic revenue barely moved.
    </p>

    <h2>Client Snapshot</h2>
    <ul class="article-list">
      <li><strong>Industry:</strong> B2B SaaS (workflow automation)</li>
      <li><strong>ACV:</strong> ~$12k</li>
      <li><strong>Initial ranking for main keyword:</strong> Position 27–32</li>
      <li><strong>Organic demo requests from SEO:</strong> 10–15 per month</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Diagnosing the Problem</h2>
    <p>
      The core issue wasn’t that their content was bad – it was invisible. Their articles lived only on their own
      domain, rarely earned links, and didn’t show up in any of the community conversations where buyers actually
      researched tools.
    </p>

    <h2>The Redaccel Plan</h2>
    <ol class="article-steps">
      <li>
        <strong>Audience & subreddit research.</strong> We identified five subreddits where their ideal buyers asked
        repeated questions about the exact pain they solved.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cornerstone content on their site.</strong> We rebuilt their main product guide to fully answer those
        questions – including examples, implementation details and screenshots.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>High‑value Reddit threads.</strong> Over six weeks we published 18 long‑form posts and 120+ comments
        across those subreddits, each linking back to the new guide or relevant feature pages when natural.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>LLM‑friendly formatting.</strong> We restructured the guide with clear headings, FAQs, schema markup and
        concise summaries that models could easily parse.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Results After 90 Days</h2>
    <ul class="article-list">
      <li><strong>Main keyword ranking:</strong> from #27 → **#2** (with several related terms in positions #1–#3).</li>
      <li><strong>Organic sessions to the guide:</strong> +420% vs. baseline.</li>
      <li><strong>Demo requests from organic:</strong> 3× increase (from ~12 / month to 36+ / month).</li>
      <li><strong>Reddit contribution:</strong> 35% of assisted conversions included a Reddit touchpoint.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why It Worked</h2>
    <p>
      The campaign succeeded because it treated Reddit and LLM ranking as one system, not two separate channels. Our
      Reddit posts drove early traffic and links, but they also seeded the exact language and insights that LLMs now use
      when generating answers. When someone asks “how do I automate X in my agency?”, the models have already seen our
      client’s content many times.

      <h3>Want a similar outcome?</h3>
      <p>
        If you have product–market fit but your search presence doesn’t reflect it, we can run the same playbook: map
        your buyer conversations, rebuild your cornerstone content, and light up Reddit with campaigns that actually
        respect the culture.
