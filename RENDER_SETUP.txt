QUICK RENDER SETUP - DO THIS:

1. Go to your Render dashboard → Your service → Environment tab

2. Add these 5 environment variables (click "Add Environment Variable" for each):

   MAIL_SERVER = smtp.hostinger.com
   MAIL_PORT = 465
   MAIL_USERNAME = contact@redaccel.com
   MAIL_PASSWORD = (set this in Render — do not store passwords in the repo)
   MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER = contact@redaccel.com

3. Save - Render will auto-redeploy

That's it! The form will now send emails to contact@redaccel.com
